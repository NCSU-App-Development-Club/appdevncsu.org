            The NC State App Development Club is a student-led organization
            focused on building real-world software through hands-on experience.
            We bring together developers of all skill levels to work on mobile
            apps for the NC State community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're new to coding or looking to sharpen your skills, our
            club provides opportunities to design beautiful user interfaces,
            contribute to full-stack projects, and learn modern development
            tools and practices.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our goal is to help NC State students become confident, capable
            software engineers through practical experience and a strong
            developer community.
